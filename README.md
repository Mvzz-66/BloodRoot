# 🩸 Blood Root - Game Overview 🩸

## 🎮 Game Concept

**Blood Root** is a 2D Metroidvania-style action-adventure game that draws inspiration from titles like *Hollow Knight*, *Dark Souls*, and *Bloodborne*. The game combines intense combat, exploration, and character progression within a dark and atmospheric world.

### 🎯 Objective

Your goal as the player is to hunt down and defeat the final boss, known as the **Lord of Chaos**. To reach this ultimate adversary, you must first collect four special keys, each guarded by a mini-boss in a separate level:

- 🔑 **Key of Broken Faith** - Guarded by *The Hollow Priest*
- 🔑 **Key of Suffering** - Guarded by *The Crimson Widow*
- 🔑 **Key of Bleeding** - Guarded by *The Rakshasa*
- 🔑 **Key of Shattered Soul** - Guarded by *The Soul Eater*

### 🌍 Levels

The game consists of 4 main levels, each one filled with dangerous enemies, hidden passages, locked doors, and secret areas. Some sections will only become accessible after acquiring new abilities. At the end of each level, you'll face a mini-boss that guards one of the essential keys.

### ⚔️ Combat System

The game's combat focuses on **attacks, dodging**, and **stamina management**. You will battle corrupted soldiers under the Lord of Chaos's command. When defeated, enemies drop **Essence**, which you can collect and use to enhance your abilities.

### 📈 Character Progression

You can use the Essence obtained from enemies to improve your character in three primary attributes:

- ❤️ **HP** (Health) – Increases your survivability.
- 💥 **Damage** – Increases the power of your attacks.
- 🏃‍♂️ **Stamina** – Enhances your mobility and combat endurance.

### 🎨 Art Style & Atmosphere

Blood Root's visual style is a blend of dark, haunting environments, featuring ruins, temples, and twisted creatures. The game's aesthetic is designed in **2D pixel art** or **dark drawings**, primarily using tones of **red and black** to create an eerie and oppressive atmosphere. The ambient soundtrack complements the gameplay, building tension, especially during boss encounters.
